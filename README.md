# Grocery-Manegment-System
This is a simple frontend-based Grocery Management System built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It lets users add, update, and delete grocery items. The total cost updates automatically. I used localStorage to persist data, so even after a page refresh, data is retained. All interactions are dynamic, managed using JavaScript DOM manipulation
